## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the bioactivity of chemical compounds. By utilizing datasets from reputable sources like the ChEMBL database, the project focuses on:

- Data collection and preprocessing of bioactivity data
- Calculation of molecular descriptors using tools like PaDEL-Descriptor
- Exploratory data analysis to understand chemical space and drug-likeness
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict compound potency

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve bioactivity data for target proteins from the ChEMBL database.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format the data, ensuring consistency and readiness for analysis.
3. **Descriptor Calculation**: Use PaDEL-Descriptor to compute molecular descriptors for each compound.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution of descriptors and assess drug-likeness using Lipinski's Rule of Five.
5. **Model Building**: Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) to predict bioactivity.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, RÂ², and visualize predictions.
